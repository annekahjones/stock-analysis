# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project went through a dataset of stock information and determined the total volume, starting price, ending price, and return of each different type of stock. We are trying to help someone decide which stock is the best one to invest in by performing different analyses on the data.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to get a better look at how different the stocks performed throughout the years 2017 and 2018. We were able to see which stocks had positive and negative returns and what the total volumes were by the end of the year, which helps investors determine which stocks they should put their money into.

## Analysis and Results

### Analysis
The stock performance between 2017 and 2018 did differ quite drastically. 2017 was a year that had pretty much all positive returns, whereas 2018 had primarily negative returns. The couple of positive returns in 2018 were very successful, but a good portion of the negative returns were negative by at least 10%. The single negative return in the 2017 analysis was only negative by less than 10% and about half of the positive returns were 50% or above.

I have added the screenshots to the GitHub.

### Results
The execution times for the standard script was significantly longer than for the refactored script. The standard script took about 0.8 seconds for each year and the refactored script took approximately 0.17 seconds; the refactored script was significantly faster at computing the calculations. This tells us that we created the refactored script properly.


## Challenges

### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring
An advantage of refactoring in general is making your code more efficient, precise, or reliable. It is always good to be improving on what you already have and trying to strive to have the best code out there. A disadvantage, however, is that this is a tedious process that doesn't always end up with a better performing code. Sometimes the code can be manipulated but still perform the same in the end.

### Pros and Cons with our VBA refacotring
I think that an advantage of refactoring the code is that the run time is much faster than the standard script. It didn't really matter in our circumstance since both run times were extremely fast, however, in a case where the run time could be a matter of minutes, the time difference would defnitely be advantageous. As for disadvantages, I honestly can't think of many. Maybe the fact that you are having to go over code that you already created, which is time consuming in itself.
